                <p> Please tell me I didn't get old. Anything but old. I was young! Oh... is he grey? Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or, as Iâ€™ve always known him, Jeff. I once spent a hell of a long time trying to get a gobby Australian to Heathrow airport. Thank you, Strax. And if I'm ever in need of advice from a psychotic potato dwarf, you'll certainly be the first to know. Usually called 'The Doctor.' Or 'The Caretaker.' Or 'Get off this planet.' Though, strictly speaking, that probably isn't a name. I know. Dinosaurs! On a spaceship! </p>
